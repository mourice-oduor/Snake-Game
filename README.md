# Snake-Game
Python classic snake game made by pygame module.


# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame
- Tkinter GUI

# .....................................................................
This is an arcade game and it has very simple logic, which demonstrates how to build games with Pygame Python Module.

The player is represented as snake, which grows if it eats an apple.
 The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding into yourself.
  This is very easy in the early phase of the game but is increasingly more difficult as the length of the snake grows.

To install pygame from pip3 you need to install all the C dependencies manually in order for pip to be able to build it.
-This happens mostly with Debian based OS, users.\
-In order to solve this, run:
# sudo apt-get install python-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion libportmidi-dev ffmpeg libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev

After this, install pygame on the terminal by;
# python3 -m pip install pygame
# python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
-Then;
# sudo pip3 install pygame
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade
