# Snake-Game
Python classic snake game made by pygame module.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame
- Tkinter GUI

To install pygame from pip3 you need to install all the C dependencies manually in order for pip to be able to build it.
-This happens mostly with Debian based OS, users.\
-In order to solve this, run:
# sudo apt-get install python-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion libportmidi-dev ffmpeg libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev

After this, install pygame on the terminal by;
# python3 -m pip install pygame
# python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
-Then;
# sudo pip3 install pygame
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade
